# Asset Requirements for Social Media Cards

## Required Images for Social Media Cards

The HTML files reference these images for social media sharing:

1. `chat-icon.png` - For main chat page social card
2. `command-icon.png` - For AI command interface social card  
3. `instructions-icon.png` - For access instructions social card

## Image Specifications

- Size: 1200x630 pixels (recommended for optimal social sharing)
- Format: PNG or JPG
- File size: Under 8MB for optimal loading

## Alternative Approach

If static images aren't available, the website will still function properly with just the meta descriptions. The social media platforms will generate previews based on the title, description, and any available content images from the page.

## Implementation Note

The HTML files reference these assets with the expectation they will be hosted at:
`https://deepseekoracle.github.io/Excavationpro/aichat/assets/[filename]`

When deployed via GitHub Pages, these paths will resolve correctly.
